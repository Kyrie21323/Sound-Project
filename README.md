# Aliens Need Dogs
By Yupu Chen, Kyrie Park, Sara Almulla, and Madina Yeleukina

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience were you striving to create?
Our project revolves around a soundscape adventure set in Earth and space, which follows a lone Alien as he looks for companionship on Earth. The overall concept centers around the audios assigned to each frame to portray the story, which allow for the immersion of the viewer into the different environments.

## The moral of the story: stereotypes, exclusion, and the value of friendship
- Humans have stereotypes and think Aliens are dangerous etc– giving people a chance might surprise you
- Pitbulls are not favored by a lot of people (i.e. they are the dangerous outsiders in the pet industry), but the alien has no prejudices and is open-minded
- You can find companionship in the unlikeliest of places, friendship gets us through hard times

# Describe your role and what your contribution was. How did you go about implementing the concept?

##  Sara:

My role was centered largely on illustrating the frames to aid in the visual part of our audiovisual story. I designed half (+ the two simple title and ending frames), while Madina designed the other half. We chose to go for a simple, cartoon-y, and smooth illustration style with no outlines, and our color palette was bright and lively but not too saturated.

We used Procreate to illustrate the frames and their components.

### Screencaps of the scenes I illustrated:

We then reused the city background for later scenes— as you’ll see in Madina’s frames.

### I also designed the alien:

### And the people:

Which was a challenge I’ll expand on later.

### After finalizing each design, I worked on writing the script for the narration and then recording it:
- Slide 1: Once upon a dark space, an alien stumbles upon a water planet.
- Slide 2: --
- Slide 3: The people there looked weird. But the alien didn’t care. He was looking for companionship in this galaxy, even if that companion wasn’t blue and bulbous like him.
- Slide 4: Nevermind.
- Slide 5: --
- Slide 6: Wait, what is that thing?
- Slide 7: --
- Slide 8: The pit bull was the perfect friend for our fellow alien. He, like the Martian, was an outsider, a supposedly ‘violent’ stray dog to the humans. They needed each other.
- Slide 9: --
- Slide 10: And so, the pit bull and the alien vowed to stay by each other’s side in allegiance, exploring the galaxy one planet at a time till the end of eternity. Hey! Might as well be eccentric together!

I tried to make it brief but straightforward— with a narrative, quirky, and conversational touch. I wanted to make sure it consulted the story without overpowering the sound effects.

I did the sound design of the project. For the sound design, I used Logic Pro X as the workplace. For the audios, I combined our original recordings with some sound samples from the NYU Stock Sound Library and Soundly (all can be accessed through iMacs in the music classroom). Thanks to the multitrack editing function of Logic Pro X, I am able to edit, add effect, and equalize all the tracks easily.

Here's the overal workspace:

For example, there are many different layers of the background noice in the city, including the car horn, talking, screaming, and footsteps. I put them on top of each other when necessary to help the narration of the story. Moreover, between different scenes I added fade-in, fade-out, or cross-fade effects (as shown also above) to make natural and smooth transitions and making the addition or removal of some layers not too sharp for the listeners.

Specifically, there are two technique/effects I used to modify the soundtracks. The first only is the effects including equalizer and amplifier, both of which are built in Logic Pro X. Together, by changing the volumes of different frequencies and imitating the functioning of an amplifier, I made the narrations sound like from an ancient, distant story teller and the alien voice more dramatic and spacelike.

Secondly, I used automation function to make the soundtracks balanced in volumes. There are two benefits. The first one is to fix the unequal volume as a result of various sound sources, and the second one is to accentuate the main sounds as the story proceeds. For example, when the alien speaks, I turned down the volume of background noise a bit so that the audience knows the alien voice is what to pay attention to. This adds to the storytelling of the soundscape.

Besides sound design, I helped design and code the webpage. I designed the About button and its content, the spinning earth that leads to the homepage, and the Audio Only button that plays the full audio. These parts of the web design help the audience navigate the website better and give them more flexibility of what to see and what to listen to. Through these designs of mine, I hope the audience could explore and enjoy the story more with their own pace.

# Reflection/Evaluation (initial vs final concept, expectations, goals, problems, results)

##  Sara:

To illustrate the frames, we first had to write the storyline. We were able to finalize this during our first meeting in-class, so I started coming up with the design style and showing my group members straight after. After I finished a scene, I uploaded it to Google Drive for my team members to check in case they had any feedback or felt that modifications needed to be made, which helped clarify the creative vision.

### Drawing the people and their arms was pretty difficult
I'm  not an artist so I'm not very well versed with human anatomy (even if it's cartoon-y), but image references certainly helped. Like in the last project, clipart versions of elements I wanted to illustrate helped me visualize how I wanted the frames to look-- and in turn helped me modify each element to suit our designated styling.
