# Aliens Needs Dogs
By Yupu Chen, Kyrie Park, Sara Almulla, and Madina Yeleukina

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience were you striving to create?
Our project revolves around a soundscape adventure set in Earth and space, which follows a lone Alien as he looks for companionship on Earth. The overall concept centers around the audios assigned to each frame to portray the story, which allow for the immersion of the viewer into the different environments.

## The moral of the story: stereotypes, exclusion, and the value of friendship
- Humans have stereotypes and think Aliens are dangerous etcâ€“ giving people a chance might surprise you
- Pitbulls are not favored by a lot of people (i.e. they are the dangerous outsiders in the pet industry), but the alien has no prejudices and is open-minded
- You can find companionship in the unlikeliest of places, friendship gets us through hard times
